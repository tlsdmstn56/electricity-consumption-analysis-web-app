testing groups to see if thereâ€™s a difference between them.

### Assumption

#### Normality

The population in each group must be close to a normal distribution.

1. Shapiro Test
```{r echo=FALSE}
shapiro.test()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r}
print(head(KWH))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
